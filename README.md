# Domain-Builder

The purpose of this script is to fill out an excel file that has all the information needed for a new phone system such as user list, voicemail, phone numbers, etc. and create the entire system for you.

It will create every user, import all the numbers, create the call flows, and piece everything together so the only thing left to do is add hold music.

Before the file gets processed, it will validate all the information to make sure there are no errors.  These can include invalid phone numbers, missing information, or bad data.  If there are any errors, it will tell you where in the file is the error and why it was flagged.  If everything is good, then it will get to work building
